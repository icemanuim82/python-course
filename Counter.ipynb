    "In this project, we will be using the time module and its sleep() function.\n",
    "Follow the below steps to create a countdown timer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Import the time module.\n",
    "1-Ask the user to input the length of the countdown in seconds.\n",
    "2-This value is sent as a parameter ‘t’ to the user-defined function countdown(). Any variable read using the input function is a string. So, convert this parameter to ‘int’ as it is of string type.\n",
    "3-In this function, a while loop runs until time becomes 0.\n",
    "4-Use divmod() to calculate the number of minutes and seconds. You can read more about it here.\n",
    "5-Now print the minutes and seconds on the screen using the variable timeformat.\n",
    "6-Using end = ‘\\r’ we force the cursor to go back to the start of the screen (carriage return) so that the next line printed will overwrite the previous one.\n",
    "7-The time.sleep() is used to make the code wait for one sec.\n",
    "8-Now decrement time so that the while loop can converge.\n",
    "9-After the completion of the loop, we will print “Fire in the hole” to signify the end of the countdown."
